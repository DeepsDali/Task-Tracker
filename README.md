# Task-Tracker
This project is designed to help people keep track of tasks they need to complete. With this task tracker you can add, edit, delete and filter tasks. This project was made for the Founders and Coders foundation course to help learn and practice automated testing.
## User stories & Acceptance Criteria
### Core Stories
As a busy person I want to:
- Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
- check things of my list so that I can see what I've done
- Delete things from the list if I don't need to do them anymore
As a motor-impaired user, I want to:
- Use all the features of the app without a mouse
### Stretch Stories
As a busy person, I want to:
- Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what's left to do
- Edit my tasks so that I can keep my tasks updated as my needs change
- Label tasks so I can easily focus on specific types of task
- Clear all completed tasks so I can avoid my list being cluttered
### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A working to-do list
- [x] Tests for (at least) each user story
- [x] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [x] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

## Future improvements
- Add a way to filter/sort by date
- Make functions more modular to improve ease of testing
## Learning outcomes
### Testing
- Check that passing a given input into our tests returns the expected output
- Write tests to mimic the behaviour of a user performing different actions
### JavaScript
- Write testable, modular functions
- Write functions that add, remove or modify DOM nodes
- Apply event listeners to HTML form elements
- Use scope to control what variables are accessible inside functions and blocks
### Design
- Use CSS grid to create complex layouts
- Use CSS grid to make layouts that adapt to the viewport size
